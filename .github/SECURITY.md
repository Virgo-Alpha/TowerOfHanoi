# Security Considerations

This application is designed with security in mind. Below are some key points to consider:

1. **Input Validation**: Ensure all user inputs are validated to prevent unexpected behavior or errors.
2. **Error Handling**: Handle exceptions gracefully to avoid crashes and to provide user-friendly feedback.
3. **Data Protection**: If applicable, ensure any sensitive data is protected through encryption or secure storage methods.

If any vulnerabilities are discovered, please report them to the project maintainers immediately.
